open command prompt [cmd + enter]

goto present project path , goto frontend folder and delete .git file

use either of these which ever works

del -rf .git     or    rm -rf .git

C:\WebDevelopment\Ecommerce-MERN\frontend>del -rf .git
Could Not Find C:\WebDevelopment\Ecommerce-MERN\frontend\-rf
C:\WebDevelopment\Ecommerce-MERN\frontend\.git\*, Are you sure (Y/N)? Y


Now cut the .gitignore file from frontend folder and paste it in parent folder , in our case ECommerce-MERN folder

and in .gitignore folder , remove the forward slash(/) before the node_modules and build , so that they wont get pushed to github


Now click on source control icon in vs code

click on Initialize repository
