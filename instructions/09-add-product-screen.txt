if product exist we will show that it is inStock and enable add to cart and update page title based on product

In ProductScreen.js copy the useReducer and useEffect from HomeScreen 
and change [products to product]
 const [{ loading, error, product }, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, {
    product: [],
    loading: true,
    error: '',
  });
await axios.get(`/api/products/slug/${slug}`);


and in backend go to server.js add a new api path

app.get('/api/products/slug/:slug', (req, res) => {
  const product = data.products.find((x) => x.slug === req.params.slug);
  if (product) {
    res.send(product);
  } else {
    res.status(404).send({ message: 'Product Not Found' });
  }
  res.send(data.products);
});

To show the page title as product name use the package
 npm i react-helmet-async

 in index.js 
 import { HelmetProvider } from 'react-helmet-async';
 and wrap App with it
 <HelmetProvider>
      <App />
    </HelmetProvider>

and then in ProductScreen.js add
<ListGroup.Item>
                  <Helmet>
                    <title>{ product.name}</title>
                  </Helmet>
              <h1>{product.name}</h1>
            </ListGroup.Item>
            <ListGroup.Item>

and also in HomeScreen.js add
 <Helmet>
        <title>ECommerce</title>
      </Helmet>
      <h1>Featured Products</h1>

To check and display unavaiable stocks we changed countInStock in data.js to 0

In server.js we added a new api to return product information based on slug
We installed react-helmet-async to display webpage meta data , like title to change
in App.js we used mt-3 to create a margin top of 3rem space between main and header section
in index.css we added a class img-large to set max-width of image
in index.js we wrapped App component with HelmetProvider
in HomeScreen.js we used Helmet to update page title to product name
in ProductScreen.js we added code for product image ,info,availablity
